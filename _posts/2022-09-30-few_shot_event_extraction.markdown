In natural language processing, event argument extraction is a crucial task that involves identifying and classifying the arguments or roles associated with an event mentioned in a text. Our paper presents a meta-learning approach for few-shot event argument extraction, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. By leveraging prototypical networks and memory-augmented networks, our method effectively handles the challenge of limited annotated data, enabling robust and accurate extraction of event arguments from minimal examples.
