    "snippet": "In natural language processing, Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a common sub-tasks of Information Extraction that consists of identifying and classifing named entities in untructured texts, into pre-defined categories such as persons, locations, organizations, etc. An entity can be any word or series of words that consistently refers to the same thing. Every detected entity is classified into a predetermined category. For example, an NER model might detect the word “Google” in a text and classify it as a “Company”."
