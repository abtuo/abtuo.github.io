      Prototypical networks are a type of few-shot learning model that was first introduced by Snell et al. 2017. They are designed to learn to classify new examples by comparing them to a small number of examples from each class, or “prototypes.” The idea behind prototypical networks is that each class can be represented by a prototype, which is a representative example of that class.

      Event extraction is the task of identifying events in a text and extracting information about the participants, time, location, and other details of the event. It is an important subtask of natural language processing (NLP) and is used in various applications such as question answering, text summarization, and knowledge base construction.

      Relation extraction is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves identifying relationships between entities in a text. These relationships can be binary (e.g., “person X is the father of person Y”) or multi-valued (e.g., “person X works at company Y and company Z”).

Relation extraction is a crucial component of information extraction systems, which aim to extract structured data f...
